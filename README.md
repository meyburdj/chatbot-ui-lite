# Concept Bot Frontend

A simple frontend forked from [chatbot-ui-lite](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui-lite.git)
and modified to use the [concept bot filter](https://github.com/meyburdj/concept_bot_filter)
as it's endpoint. The frontend treats the displayed messages and prompt message
context as two seperate pieces of state. In future versions, prompt messages will be 
moved to the backend.
